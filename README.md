# CMPM-121 HW 1 AND 2
 
<p>HW #1: My scene is a little farmhouse surrounded by hills. I started with the idea of wanting to make my own terrain, and I knew I wanted
some buildings which led me to find these two farm type of houses. After seeing those houses on the Unity store I got inspired to make 
a scene inspired by the book Animal Farm. I added various types of rocks and trees to make the environment more filled out. Next to the 
houses I added boxes, crates, a broom, and more to make the house more lived in. Lastly, I added the animals. The pig is the main character 
because it is on a box giving what it seems like a speech to the rest of the animals. In my head the pig is talking about how all the animals have to escape the farm before they turn into the goathead, which is hanging on one of the houses.</p>

<p>HW #2: For the 4 lighting types I included a point light on the first floor of the Big House, a spotlight on the second floor, a directional light for the sun, and an area light in the Old House. All the lights besides the directional light represent a different type of candle. The day and night cycle was based on a Youtube tutorial I found. I also added a UI button that turns all 4 lights on/off/dim. For the 2D Texture emitter I included stink bubbles coming off a bucket in the Old House and flames coming off the candle in the second story. For the 3D Mesh emitter I have a firefly prefab that for the candle on the first floor of the Big House. I added objects around all the lighting to give off shadows. My idea for the whole scene is that the houses are empty right now of humans as the animals are having their meeting, but the humans are coming back soon as eivdent fomr the candles being lit.</p>
